## Frequency Tables for attacking a substitution cipher by Notre Dame:

[Frequency Table 1](https://www3.nd.edu/~busiforc/handouts/cryptography/cryptography%20hints.html)
[Frequency Table 2](https://www3.nd.edu/~busiforc/handouts/cryptography/Letter%20Frequencies.html)

Please note that they only reflect the occurences of `n`-graphs within word boundaries. For example, even if "want to" has a hight frequency, "ntto" are simply ignored by this kind of tables.
