# cryptoTools
This is a toolkit of undergrad math class Cryptography. Created mainly for UCSC MATH134 Spring 2024.

##I will upload tools and (maybe) solutions to some homework problems here each week.

# Other Useful Tools:
###Frequency Tables for attacking a substitution cipher:
[Frequency Table 1](https://www3.nd.edu/~busiforc/handouts/cryptography/cryptography%20hints.html)
[Frequency Table 2](https://www3.nd.edu/~busiforc/handouts/cryptography/Letter%20Frequencies.html)

Please note that they only reflects the occurences of `n`-graphs within words. For example, even if "want to" has a hight frequency, "ntto" are simply ignored by this kind of tables.
